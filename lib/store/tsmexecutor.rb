#
#  tsm = TsmExecutor.new('BERNARD_SERVER')   ; production tapes for DAITSS

#
#
# No expected exceptions should be raised out of this class.  Instead,
# look at the status attribute, a fixnum:
#
#  *   0 Success.
#  *   4 General success, but some files were not processed
#  *   8 There were some warnings.
#  *  12 General failure.
#  * 253 Can't happen.
#  * 254 Failure in popen.
#  * 255 Timeout for dsmc.
#
# Use Tsm#output and Tsm#errors to investigate, and if necessary, log the situation.

    # 254:  error in popen (bad args, for example)
    # 253:  something's really odd.
    #
    # From the IBM manual:
    #
    #    Status code 0: All operations completed successfully.
    #
    #    Status code 4:  The operation completed successfully, but some files were not
    #    processed. There were no other errors or warnings. This return code is
    #    very common. Files are not processed for various reasons. The most
    #    common reasons are:
    #
    #      * The file satisfies an entry in an exclude list.
    #
    #      * The file was in use by another application and could not be 
    #        accessed by the client.
    #
    #      * The file changed during the operation to an extent prohibited by
    #        the copy serialization attribute. See “Copy serialization” on page
    #        215.
    #
    #    Status code 8: The operation completed with at least one warning
    #    message. For scheduled events, the status will be Completed. Review
    #    dsmerror.log (and dsmsched.log for scheduled events) to determine what
    #    warning messages were issued and to assess their impact on the
    #    operation.
    #
    #    Status code 12: The operation completed with at least one error
    #    message (except for error messages for skipped files). For scheduled
    #    events, the status will be Failed. Review the dsmerror.log file (and
    #    dsmsched.log file for scheduled events) to determine what error
    #    messages were issued and to assess their impact on the operation. As a
    #    general rule, this return code means that the error was severe enough
    #    to prevent the successful completion of the operation. For example, an
    #    error that prevents an entire file system or file specification from
    #    being processed yields return code 12.
